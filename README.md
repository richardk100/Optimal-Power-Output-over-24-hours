# Optimal Power Output Over 24 Hours

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the power output of a wind turbine using linear programming techniques. The goal is to maximize the energy output over a 24-hour period while considering constraints such as wind speed and maintenance hours. The project also includes visualization of the optimized power output.

## Features

- Optimization of wind turbine power output using linear programming
- Consideration of wind speed constraints (cut-in and cut-out speeds)
- Handling maintenance hours where power output is set to zero
- Visualization of the optimized power output over a 24-hour period

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pulp`: For linear programming
- `matplotlib`: For plotting results

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pulp matplotlib
